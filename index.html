              Hello and Welcome! My name is Hunter Harrison, and that guy there next to me is Coda. I am the owner and lead consultant here at Coda Development.
              I have over 6 years of experience in software engineering and over 5 years of experience in technology consulitng. I am a client obsessed empathetic leader who
              relishes a good problem to solve. I strive to work with my clients to develop a solution that is right with them. My experience has placed me building applications
              for a Big accounting firm with hundreds of thousands of users to building in-house software for mom and pop businesses. I truly believe that there is no problem too 
              big (or small) if people are willing to work together.
